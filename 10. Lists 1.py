"""This is a very efficient submission for this activity! You've used the correct syntax for the list; 
your brackets are correct, and you've split all your list elements up with a comma. Great attention to detail!

You've continued to demonstrate your confidence with dot notation with your list methods. 
Using append twice is perfect - as it only takes one arguement, we can only use it to add one thing. 
You've also demononstrated your underastanding of .pop() to remove the final item. Well done!"""
